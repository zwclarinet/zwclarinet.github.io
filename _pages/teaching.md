I have extensive teaching experience as a clarinet instructor, working with students of all levels in both academic and private settings. At Boston Universityâ€™s College of Fine Arts, I teach non-major clarinet students, providing instruction on foundational and advanced techniques. Previously, I served as a clarinet section coach at Kang Chiao International School in Taiwan, where I trained students in chamber music and wind ensemble performance. Additionally, I have been a private clarinet tutor since 2016, mentoring students for competitions and performances while fostering their artistic growth.

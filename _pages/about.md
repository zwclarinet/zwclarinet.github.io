I am a clarinetist and educator, currently a Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) candidate at Boston University. I have performed at Carnegie Hall, Boston Symphony Hall, and Jordan Hall, and won the Boston University Soloists’ Competition, performing Nielsen’s Clarinet Concerto. I have played with ensembles like the Boston University Symphony Orchestra, Apollo Ensemble of Boston, and Boston Civic Symphony Orchestra.

As an educator, I teach at Boston University and mentor young clarinetists. I was inducted into the Pi Kappa Lambda Music Honor Society and invited as a speaker at the International Clarinet Festival in Taiwan. Passionate about chamber music, I have been a finalist in competitions such as Buffet Crampon Asia Pacific, Plowman, and Coltman.
